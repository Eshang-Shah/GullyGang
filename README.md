# Problem Statement:
In this digital age, we have lost a community touch to our regular activities such as playing cricket, football, basketball, etc. with our “Mohalla” friends. It's difficult to gather players or friends to organize a match. Lack of information about many sports centers or events that offer an opportunity to play is evident. You just don't know where to go and what to do, when all you want is to play. 

# Solution Statment:
To develop an online platform where people who want to play are matched with others who also want to play the same sport at the same level, where they can organize games with other players and teams around where they live.
